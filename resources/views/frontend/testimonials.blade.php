                  The trip went exactly as per plan without any hiccups. The Back2Travel agent, Ritesh, did a great job of planning the trip as per my needs. Thanks! Ritesh. Will be looking forward to Travel Triangle for planning my future trips too. The Kecak dance was great. Liked the trip to Nusa Penida and Besakih as well. Enjoyable tour.

                  It was overall good experience. The only negative was the meals covered in the itinerary. The candle light dinner was not so good and the lunch on Nusa Penida island was horrible. Apart from that, the trip was amazing. The driver was very well behaved. The hotel was superb.
